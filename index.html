				<h1>SARS</h1>
				<p id="section-intro">Severe acute respiratory syndrome: a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus. It is a serious form of pneumonia.</p>
				<div class="container">
					<ul>
						<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
						<li>Flu like symptoms initally:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Fever</li>
							<li>Chills</li>
							<li>Muscle Aches</li>
							<li>Diarrhea</li>
						</ul>
						<li>After 1 week:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Fever (over 38 degrees celsius)</li>
							<li>Dry cough</li>
							<li>Shortness of breath</li>
							<li>Pneumonia</li>
							<li>Heart & liver failure</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Treatment</h3>
						<p>There is no available vaccine for SARS yet, but many are being tested and worked on. Various antiviral agents are used during epidemics, but their effectiveness is questionable. These agents can reduce the severity of symptoms, but aren’t useful for every single person. There is not enough evidence to prove that any of those treatments would work.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Diffusion:</h3>
						<p style="padding-right: 20px">When someone infected with SARS coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray and spread into the air. You can be infected if you breathe in or touch these SARS particles. SARS virus can live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to 6 hours in droplet form and up to 3 hours after those droplets have dried. Thus it can spread through contaminated objects and not just “close contact”. It is able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3 id="separateh3">Prevention:</h3>
				<p id="nine">There are many strategies that one can do to reduce their chances of getting SARS such as: washing your hands, wearing disposable gloves/surgical mask to prevent contact, washing personal items that may have come into contact with someone who has SARS, and disinfecting surfaces.</p>

				<h1>HIV/Aids</h1>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that can lead to Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not treated properly. HIV attacks the immune system of the patient (T-cells). This will eventually reduce the amount of T-cells in the body, which will make the person more likely to acquire infections or infection-related cancers. Over a period of time, HIV can kill so many of those cells that the body will be unable to fight off infections. The final stage of HIV is AIDS, when the immune system is severely weakened.</p>
				<div class="container">
					<ul>
						<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
						<p>There are 3 stages in HIV. Each stage will have different and varying symptoms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Early stage (2-4 weeks):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Flu-like symptoms</li>
								<li>Fever</li>
								<li>Chills</li>
								<li>Rash</li>
								<li>Muscle aches</li>
								<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Clinical Latency Stage(~10 years):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>HIV produced at very low levels (but can still be transmitted)</li>
								<li>Generally no symptoms at this stage</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Progression to AIDS:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Rapid weight loss</li>
								<li>Extreme tiredness</li>
								<li>Many more</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Treatment:</h3>
						<p>There is a series of pills, PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), that you take after being exposed to HIV which can lower your chances of getting that disease if you take it within 72 hours. Another way is to take an HIV antiviral. It suppresses HIV to slow the progression of infection, and can reduce the risk of infecting others.</p>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Diffusion:</h3>
						<p>HIV is spread in certain body fluids such as: blood, semes, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. In the United States, HIV is mainly spread through sex or sharing of drug equipment such as needles. It can also spread from an HIV-infected mother to her child during pregnancy.</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3 id="separateh3">Prevention:</h3>
				<p id="nine">There is no vaccine for HIV. The only other 100% no risk way is to not have sex, but seeing as most people do at some point in their lives, people have to resort to other methods of prevention. Always use condoms as they greatly lower the risk of getting HIV. There is also a pill called PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which you take once a day to prevent HIV.</p>

				<h1>Ebola</h1>
				<p id="section-intro">An infectious and potentially fatal disease that was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River. Scientists believe the virus is animal-borne, and the most probable vector are bats. </p>
				<div class="container">
					<ul id="symptoms-ebola">
						<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
						<li>Fever</li>
						<li>Severe Headache</li>
						<li>Muscle Pain</li>
						<li>Weakness</li>
						<li>Fatigue</li>
						<li>Diarrhea</li>
						<li>Vomiting</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Treatment:</h3>
						<li>Providing intravenous fluids (IV) and balancing electrolytes (body salts).</li>
						<li>Maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure.</li>
						<li>Treating other infections if they occur.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Diffusion:</h3>
						<p>Direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is infected with or has died from the Ebola virus. It can be through touching infected body fluids (or different objects that are also contaminated), through broken skin or mucous membranes, or sexual contact as well. It can also spread through direct contact with blood, body fluids, and issues of infected bats and primates (transmitted to by bats)</p>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3 id="separateh3">Prevention:</h3>
				<p id="nine">There is no available vaccine for Ebola. The most one can do is to practice good hygiene and to avoid contact with any possible contamination such as:</p>
				<ul id="end-list">
					<li>Items that were from a contaminated person</li>
					<li>Wild animals (especially bats and primates)</li>
					<li>Funerals of those who has died of Ebola.</li>
