# Biology Project on Diseases
Project details can be found here: https://pastebin.com/DQq9gYde
## Background
A small website dedicated to a biology project for spring 2018. The class is for non-majors and the assignment was very open ended so I decided to take this opportunity and delve a little further into CSS. My partner did all of the content for the site while I worked on the site itself
## Technologies
I used zenscroll to avoid the hassle of writing any javascript cause my main focus for this project was css. This also let me avoid having to install jquery or any other dependencies
